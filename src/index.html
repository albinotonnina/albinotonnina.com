        <p>Self-taught Web Engineer, Freelancer, Employee, Entrepreneur</p>

      <div>
        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Albino Tonnina, and I'm a self-taught web engineer. My
          journey has taken me through different roles and experiences‚ÄîI've been
          a freelancer, an employee, and an entrepreneur. Each chapter has
          shaped who I am today and taught me valuable lessons about both
          technology and life.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>The London Adventure</h2>
        <p>
          In 2014, I made one of the most significant decisions of my life: I
          left Rome and moved to London. This turned out to be the best
          adventure of my life ü§ó.
        </p>
        <p>
          In London, I've met amazing engineers who made me a much better
          developer. The collaborative environment and diverse perspectives have
          been instrumental in my growth. In 2018, I joined ASOS as a senior
          software engineer, and I'm now a Staff Engineering Lead. But it wasn't
          just about work‚Äîa few important things happened in my personal life as
          well üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëßüòä.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Contributing to the Community</h2>
        <p>
          When I can, I like to contribute to the community in various ways. I
          publish code on my GitHub profile, write about software engineering,
          and contribute to other open source projects. I believe in the power
          of sharing knowledge and helping others grow in their development
          journey.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          What really blows my mind is hearing from people who say this website
          inspired them. That's just... wow. I never expected that. It is just a
          personal project, a way to share what I love. Knowing it helped
          someone else take a step forward? That's everything. üíõ
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>A Message of Gratitude</h2>
        <p>
          So, if you're watching this, thank you for being part of this journey.
          I hope you find something here that inspires you too.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          The path isn't always clear. Sometimes, it feels like climbing in the
          dark, guided only by the faint glow of what you hope to become.
        </p>
        <p>
          But every step teaches you something. Every stumble shapes your
          stride. And one day, you look back and realize‚Äîyou've built your own
          mountain.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Keep climbing. The view is worth it.</strong>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Wisdom from Experience</h2>
        <p>
          I used to think the best developers were the ones who knew the most.
          Now I know they're the ones who help the most.
        </p>
        <p>
          This shift in perspective has fundamentally changed how I approach my
          work and interactions with fellow developers. Technical knowledge is
          important, but the ability to mentor, support, and uplift others in
          the community is what truly makes a difference.
