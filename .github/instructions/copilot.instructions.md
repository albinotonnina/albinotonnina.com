- Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.
- Optimize for performance where necessary.
- Use type annotations where applicable to improve code clarity.
- Follow the project's existing coding style and conventions.
- Ensure code is modular and reusable.
- Use descriptive commit messages that explain the changes made.
- Avoid hardcoding values; use configuration files or environment variables instead.
- Use logging for debugging and monitoring purposes.
- Ensure code is secure and follows best practices for security.
- Use design patterns where appropriate to solve common problems.
- Keep the user experience in mind when developing features.
- Use semantic versioning for releases.
- Ensure compatibility with the latest versions of dependencies.
- Write code that is easy to read and understand for other developers.
- Use linters and formatters to maintain code quality.
- Follow best practices for asynchronous programming.
